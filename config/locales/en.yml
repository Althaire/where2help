        Imagine...

        you arrive somewhere to volunteer and find out that you aren't needed, because there all already enough volunteers.

        <strong>Where2Help</strong> is a tool to easiyl get the right number of volunteers to the right place at the right time.

        NGOs can create a help-request. Registered volunteers assign themselves to open shifts via the mobile- or webapp. NGOs have an easy overview on how many volunteers will be around and how many are still needed. And the volunteers know exactly when to be where.
